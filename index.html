             <h1 style ="margin-right: 10px;">About Me</h1>
              <p style ="margin-right: 10px;">In 2014, I was working in Finance + stock trading floor at a large downtown company. I had a lot of friends at the company, and enjoyed the daily stock market watch, 
               but I didn't feel like my talents were fully explored when simply placing trades for other people.
              After careful though, I decided to leave the company and begin a new job in technology. It's been a great ride, with 3 companies in the Twin Cities.
             I began my job at Code42, the cloud backup-company, to start my new career in Tech Support + Billing, learning about server log scanning, local log dives, archive requirements, port connections, 
             router updates, and general OS troubleshooting that would prevent our software from backing up a file. 
             I then took an full stack webdeveloper certificate program with MCTC - it was a 6 week intro into HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL, to describe how full stack development works. 
             When a recruiter reached out from GovDelivery, I decided to make the hop over to St. Paul, to expand my HTML and CSS skills on the email platform.
             I spent 2 years with GovDelivery, learning email design, Twilio text messaging, and then supporting the software using Zendesk for external communications, and Salesforce and Jira for internal communications. 
             We helped prioritize bugs, enhancements, and worked on-call 24/7 for one week at a time to support server migrations and failover events.  
              and then expanded into coding over the successive years.  While at GovDelivery, our company was sold and became Granicus. I took advantage of the tuitition reimbursement program, and 
              began to take classes to complete my second Bachelor's Degree, this time in Computer Science. I took  classes in Java, Python 
              and discrete math at MetroState University.
              </p>
              <br>
              When the University of Minnesota began to offer a part-time coding bootcamp to become a full-stack web developer, I knew the program was right for me. During the U of MN program, 
              we learned Jquery, API queries, NodeJS with Express servers, handlebars, mySQL with the Sequelize wrapper, MongoDB.
